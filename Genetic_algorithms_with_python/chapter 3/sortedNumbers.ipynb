    "We need to somehow prefer sequences with small gaps between the runs to those with large gaps. There are a couple of ways to do that. One way that is often seen when the engine has constraints on the type of the fitness value is to scale up the fitness value, multiplying by a large value like 1000 for example, and then subtracting the amount of the gap. Another way would be to make the fitness score a floating point value with the gap value in the decimal portion and subtracted from 1. These would both work but we then have to decode them either mentally or actually if we want to break out each part of the fitness value for display.\n",
    "Lucky for us our engine doesn’t have a type limitation so we’re going to keep the values separate but encapsulated in a problem-specific fitness object that can be compared to its own type. This allows us to determine the better of two gene sequences based on their fitness, while making the fitness object responsible for how it is displayed."
